## wxSnow

wxSnow is a festive application that draws snowflakes falling on your desktop, but behind other windows so as not to be too distracting.

- Eight different snowflake bitmaps.
- Show more or less snowflakes (100 to 500).
- Make snowflakes fall faster or slower.
- Make snowflakes rotate or not rotate. (Rotation takes more CPU power.)
- System tray icon to change settings or exit the application.
